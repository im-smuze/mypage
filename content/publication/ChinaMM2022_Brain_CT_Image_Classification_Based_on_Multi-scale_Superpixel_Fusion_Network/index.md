abstract: 'In recent years, the medical image classification based on deep learning has become a new hot topic. Brain CT images lack natural visual features such as brightness, color and texture that can be easily recognized, and the morphology and location of lesions are variable. However, the convolutional neural network, which is widely used for image feature extraction, cannot effectively mine the lesion features of Brain CT images, thus affecting the classification performance. According to the visual characteristics of Brain CT images, this paper proposes a novel Brain CT image classification method based on multi-scale superpixel fusion network (MSFN). MSFN is able to extract more expressive classification features through image fusion and feature fusion. Firstly, the original Brain CT image is enhanced by multi-scale superpixel to obtain the optimized fusion image. Then, we combine the high- level features of the fusion image with the multi-scale superpixel low-level features to obtain more discriminative features for the classification of Brain CT images. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.'
