abstract: 'Brain disease has become a common threat to human life and health, and brain Com- puted Tomography (CT) is an indispensable radiological diagnostic procedure. Convo- lutional Neural Networks (CNN) have achieved remarkable performance on the natural image classification task. However, compared with natural images, 1) the brain CT im- ages contain more noisy information, and 2) the brain lesions are unstable in shapes and locations. These challenges increase the difficulty of capturing lesion information un- der the conventional CNN models which represent uniform grid-level features of neural receptive fields with equal sizes and shapes. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi- scale Superpixel based Hierarchical Attention (MSHA) model to improve the brain CT classification by introducing multi-scale superpixels to a hierarchical fusion struc- ture to remove noise and help the model focus on lesion areas. MSHA contains three modules: a Semantic-level Information Extractor (SIE), a Mixed Multi-head Attention (MMA) module, and a Hierarchical Fusion Structure (HFS). Specifically, SIE extracts semantic-level features that contain appearance and geometry information based on the superpixel of the brain image. Then, MMA learns the appearance and geometry at- tention of the multi-scale superpixel regions through a mixed attention model. Finally, HFS connects and fuses the mixed multi-head attention features of superpixel regions at different scales from coarse to fine in a hierarchical structure. Experimental results on the CQ500-based brain CT dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.'
